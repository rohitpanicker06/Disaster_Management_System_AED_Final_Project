**CONTEXT**
Our Disaster Manaagement System application is designed to aid society to find quick safety from natual disasters in their locality. Disasters can range from Hurricanes to Tornadoes. The application allows us to record disasters happening around any area, the date the disaster happened and enable us to view all disasters recorded. We can then assign a SiteReporting Employee to the disaster that was recorded and create reports of the casualties per each disaster and print them. The civil response head will be able to view all the active disasters and  will initiate a report that addresses the level of severity and risk and assign to forces like Army, Navy and Police. The army head will get the report assigned by the Civil Response head and he will then assign one or more employees/officers to work on the task. Now, the army officer views the assigned task by the army head and will begin his activity. The fund raising head will can created new fund raisers for all the disasters reported and can raise funds in any currency and will be able to publish to television, radio and social media. There is a charity entity that can choose a disaster for which funds raising was announced based on. The charity can then donate funds to the fund raising event based on the medium they heard about the fund raising which is through television, radio or social media or a mix of these mediums. Once the funds are donated, the charity enitty can view the bar for how much money the donations was made agianst how much money the fund raiser has requested. So now the fund raising head will be able to view a report on how much money was donated to the fund raiser for a disaster and against how much the fund raiser had requested. The report can be represented statistically in the form of a bar chart. The hospital is an organization that consists of Doctors, Patients and Pharmacies. A Doctor can write prescriptions for all the patients affected by the disaster; they can write medicines to them. Next, a pharmacy can get the prescription written to the patient affected by the disaster and can approve the the prescription and bill the amount due by the patient. The bill will be emailed to the user's mobile phone and he can view the patient and their medicines prescribed by the doctor and view the price of the medicines. Within the hospital organization, there is a hospital admin who can view all hospitals, delete a certain hospital, view all doctors within the selected hospital, and can view all patients within a hospital as well.
